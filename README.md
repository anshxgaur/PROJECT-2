# 📊 Python Project for Data Science: Tesla & GameStop Stock/Revenue Dashboard

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project involves extracting, analyzing, and visualizing historical stock and revenue data for **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** using Python. The goal is to build a dual-axis dashboard that compares stock price trends with quarterly revenue data.

## 📦 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- `yfinance` for stock data extraction  
- `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping revenue data  
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

## 📁 Project Structure
-Question 1`: Extract Tesla stock data using `yfinance`
-Question 2`: Scrape Tesla revenue data from Macrotrends
-Question 3`: Extract GameStop stock data using `yfinance`
- `Question 4`: Scrape GameStop revenue data from Macrotrends
- `Question 5`: Plot Tesla stock graph using `make_graph` function
- `Question 6`: Plot GameStop stock graph using `make_graph` function
- `Question 7`: Share notebook via public URL (GitHub or Watson Studio)

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- Dual-axis plots for each company showing:
  - Stock price over time (left y-axis)
  - Quarterly revenue trends (right y-axis)
- Clear titles, labeled axes, and gridlines for readability

## 📸 Screenshots
Screenshots of `.head()`, `.tail()`, and dashboard plots are included in the notebook as required by Coursera.
